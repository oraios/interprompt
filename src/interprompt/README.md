# The interprompt Package

This package is independent of Serena. It contains code by Oraios AI that we developed for
convenient handling of prompt templating in various situations, in particular in multi-language scenarios
(hence the name as portmanteau from internationalization prompting)

It is not yet released as separate package and will be developed together with Serena.

While Serena itself does not need the multi-language aspect (for now), `interprompt` helps
with loading and rendering of the templates through the autogenerated `prompt_factory` module.

The main (and usually only) entry point one needs is the function `interprompt.autogenerate_prompt_factory_module`
that will generate a module with a `PromptFactory` class that contains one method per prompt template and prompt list.
For a single-language case, the main added value from that class are the method names and the parameter names that are read off
from the jinja templates, allowing clean and safe templating within python without having to write any code.

For multi-language use cases, the `PromptFactory` adds even more value by offering simple and unified interfaces for
internationalization in prompting.
